## Mobile Encryption
This is the source code of [a demo application](https://globalinput.co.uk/global-input-app/mobile-encryption), demonstrating how you can use the [Global Input App library](https://github.com/global-input/global-input-react) to achieve [Mobile Encryption](https://globalinput.co.uk/global-input-app/mobile-content-encryption) on a React.js application to allow your users to use their mobile devices to encrypt or decrypt content so that you do not have to worry about securing encryption keys that encrypt data, and allow your users to take complete control over the security of their data. The communication between the mobile and your application is secured using end-to-end encryption. 

### How to Run

```
   git clone https://github.com/global-input/mobile-encryption.git
   cd mobile-encryption
   npm install
   npm start
```
