## Mobile Encryption
This is an example React application that uses [the ReactJS library](https://github.com/global-input/global-input-react) to implement mobile integration that allows users to use their mobiles to encrypt content on the applications. Since the encryption never leaves the mobile device and the encryption/decryption takes place within the mobile, hence device applications can implement encryption strategy without worrying about where to store their master keys. 


You may download the example and run the following command.
```
   yarn start
```
