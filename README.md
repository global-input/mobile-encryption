## Mobile Encryption
This example application demonstrates how you can use the [ReactJS library](https://github.com/global-input/global-input-react) to implement mobile integration that allows users to use their mobiles to encrypt content on the applications. Since the encryption never leaves the user's mobile device and the encryption/decryption takes place within the mobile app, applications can implement encryption strategy without worrying about where to store their master keys. 


### How to Run
You may download the example source code and run the following command.
```
   npm install
   yarn start
```
